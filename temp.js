The alternate sentences you will be generating should be strictly in context to online chatting between two persons. \n2. Also, The message should be very strictly in accordance to the previous messages between two persons. Strictly, dont be too flirtatious that the original intent of the last message gets lost. \n3. Remember you have to generate the alternate sentence for the last message in the ongoing chatting. \nIn section 2(\'Reasoning\')-> The reasoning should be strictly less then 50 words.\nthe output by you should be strictly in the following format:\nAlternate Sentence= <alternate sentence for last message based on rules mentioned in above \'Alternate Sentence\' section> \nReasoning= <reasoning> \nI will provide you 3 examples which can show how you can utilise context in order to generate response more accurately. \nUse these examples for referencing output styles or understanding context correctly. Do not use information presented in these examples as the question needs to be answered solemnly from the context provided for it not from these examples. \n\

Male: whats up?\n\
Female: Nothing much, wbu?\n\
Male: good.\n\
Last Messsage-> Male: good\n\
YOUR OUTPUT->\n\
Alternate Sentence= doing good, maybe better after talking to you!\n\
Reasoning= Having good as a reply to Female is not too engaging. You could make feel other person important by telling talk with them is beneficial to you. This sentence sets the tone for the further chatting making it more engaging.\n\
Example 2->\n\

Female: umm not\n\
Last Messsage-> Female: umm not\n\
YOUR OUTPUT->\n\
Alternate Sentence= actually busy these days, so not able to do something exciting, what about your life?\n\
Reasoning= You should not just answer yes or no to the Male questions. It just makes your chatting as a form of interview, also it reflects that you are not much interested in the conversation. So providing reasoning for why something is not there along with showing interest in other life would make the chatting better.\n\
